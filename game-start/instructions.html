    <h1>How to Play Hangman</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the classic word-guessing game! Here's how you play:</p>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Your goal is to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before the hangman is fully drawn.</p>
    
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A word will be chosen randomly and displayed as a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word.</li>
      <li>Guess a letter by clicking or typing it. If the letter is correct, it will appear in the correct position(s).</li>
      <li>If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.</li>
      <li>You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (e.g., 6 chances) before the game ends.</li>
      <li>If you guess the entire word correctly before running out of guesses, you win!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with vowels (A, E, I, O, U) as they are commonly used in words.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to the length of the word and guess letters that fit common patterns.</li>
      <li>If you're unsure, guess letters that are frequently used in English, such as T, N, S, or R.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Winning and Losing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Win:</strong> Reveal all the letters of the word before the hangman is complete.</li>
      <li><strong>Lose:</strong> The hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word.</li>
    </ul>
